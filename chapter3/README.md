# Chapter 3 – Norms  

This chapter covers vector and matrix norms. The `norms.py` file contains Python functions that compute various vector and and matrix norms (1‑norm, 2‑norm, infinity norm) using NumPy.  

- **vector_norms(x)** – Computes the 1-, 2-, and ∞-norms of a vector `x`.  
- **matrix_norms(A)** – Computes the 1-, 2-, and ∞-norms of a matrix `A`.  

The docstrings explain the properties of norms, such as non-negativity, the triangle inequality, and homogeneity. You can use these functions to verify numerical results or as examples for your own implementation.
