# Chapter 1 Solutions  

This directory contains solutions to the computational problems in Chapter 1 of *Numerical Linear Algebra* by Lloyd N. Trefethen and David Bau, III.  

- **outer_product_rank.py**: Demonstrates that the outer product of two non‑zero vectors has rank 1 by computing the outer product and its rank.  
- **coefficients_expansion.py**: Computes the coefficients expressing a vector as a linear combination of the columns of a matrix using least‑squares approximation.
